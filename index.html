                    If we're gonna walk though the woods, we need a little path. I'll go over the colors one more time that we use: Titanium white, Thalo green, Prussian blue, Van Dyke brown, Alizarin crimson, Sap green, Cad yellow, and Permanent red. Let your imagination be your guide. Use your imagination, let it go. Let the paint work.

                    We'll throw some old gray clouds in here just sneaking around and having fun. Pretend you're water. Just floating without any effort. Having a good day. Don't fight it, use what happens. Happy painting, God bless. We'll do another happy little painting. From all of us here, I want to wish you happy painting and God bless, my friends.

                    I can't think of anything more rewarding than being able to express yourself to others through painting. No worries. No cares. Just float and wait for the wind to blow you around. Have fun with it. This is gonna be a happy little seascape. Just let this happen. We just let this flow right out of our minds. There it is.
